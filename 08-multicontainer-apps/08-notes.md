### Single container application issues
- suitable only for simple apps without any external dependencies (databases or APIs)
- the image was built multiple times - when we run travis CI and when we deploy it to AWS
- how do we connect to a database from the container?

### App overview 
Over-the-top Firbonacci calculator :)  - skipped JS section altogether
